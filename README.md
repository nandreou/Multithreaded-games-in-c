Here there are four programs that work on multithread (POSIX API).

1:Coocking-game. Here there are 10 stoves from where the coockers (Threads) are consuming gas.

2:Dice-game. Here the Threads are the players who roll the dice and the one with the highest wins. Accepts as users input the number of games that are going to be played.

3:Login-logout: It is like a simulation of a server queque in games using semaphores to control the traffic (Threads here work as players).

4:Water-tank-game: In this game there is a water tank from which buckets(threads) are getting filled. One thread fills the water-tank(you can use more threads to do this job ofc I just used only one here) and the rest 4 are the buckets that are consuming it. The process goes on unti the 4 buckets are full and the program closes. It is a really good excercise to understand how condition-variables work. 

PS: The source of these excerses - games are from youtube channel code vault. I solved them in a time that I was starting to learn about multithread and they really helped me to understand things. If you want to solve the same check the channel (Code Vault) but DO NOT CHECK the answers (dont cheat :-) ).
